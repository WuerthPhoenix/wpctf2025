# Challenge Description: Spy Infiltration

You are a spy who has successfully infiltrated a high-tech company. Your mission is to steal a critical password used by the company's IoT devices to communicate with their central server. This password is the key to unlocking their secure communication network. After weeks of covert operations, you have finally gained access to the company's configuration software. However, the password remains hidden, encrypted within the configuration data. The software interface provides limited access, and the encryption mechanism is designed to keep intruders at bay. Your task is to analyze the configuration software, exploit its vulnerabilities, and exfiltrate the hidden password. Use your cryptographic skills and ingenuity to uncover the secret. Can you outsmart the system and retrieve the password without being detected? The fate of your mission depends on it.
