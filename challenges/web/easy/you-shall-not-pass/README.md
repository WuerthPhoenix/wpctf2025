# You shall not pass!
You’re an Agent in a world where digital signatures are the backbone of trust.

One day, you heard about a secret meeting where only the Superior Officers are invited. You cannot see it among your Communications, but you really want to take part in it. You are too curious!!

Every access request, every role assignment, every token is signed and verified to keep the wrong eyes out. But what happens when the system trusts… without actually verifying? A crack in the logic and a clever mind are just enough to search for that invitations.

Your mission:

Log in using your credentials `ShadowPulse:6vFZ+0/9H%ic=5V?` and find the secret invitation, including the location and the access code to infiltrate.

Good luck, Agent. Not everything that's signed is secure, and not everything that's hidden stays that way.
