# Once Upon a Dev with a Fistful of Pixels

> An eccentric indie game developer, fascinated by western films and the lone-gunslinger ideal, has been fired after accusations of intellectual property theft. But the story doesn’t end there, deleted accounts, recurring aliases, and hidden repositories suggest something deeper.
Your mission is to dig through his digital traces, connect the dots, and identify any potential collaborators.
In this data-dust desert, every pixel matters — and the truth, as always, isn’t just black and white.

> NOTE: The entire challenge is composed by 3 steps, as separate challenges. All the flags in each step are required.

## Part 1

### Flag 1

What is one of the favourite film of the developer?

As we sifted through the code he’d written during his time at the company, a few scattered comments caught our attention — each mentioning a curious handle, @el_pico. We weren’t sure why he kept referencing it, but something about it felt like a clue worth following. Remember the flag should be composed by the string WPCTF{Name of the film}

### Flag 2

Who is the main actor of the film?

Great! It seems he used a profile picture that might be linked to a specific character portrayed by an actor. Can you identify the actor’s full name? Remember, the flag should follow the format WPCTF{Name and surname of the actor}.

## Part 2 (requires part 1)

### Flag 1
Where he's hiding his files?

It seems he had a passion for experimenting with “new” technologies. Can you figure out what kind of technology he was using and whether there are any public resources that include details or documents revealing more information about him? You might find an interesting hint hidden within some of those files. You could find a flag in one of them.

### Flag 2
A name of one of his project

Can you discover the name of a project he developed? Its name might appear when you run it. Remember, the flag should follow the format WPCTF{Name of the project}.

## Part 3 (requires part 2)

### Flag 1
El malo mariachi

Can you identify the top player who achieved the highest score in the game Cowboy Shodown? Remember, the flag should follow the format WPCTF{@Name of the player}.

### Flag 2

Strange interests

Great — we’ve almost gathered all the evidence we need. It seems that the top player you identified earlier also contributed to the development of the game. Can you uncover his real identity or perhaps find out what hobbies he pursues outside of development? Follow his traces and look for what might reveal his personal interests. Some of them appear to be connected to a collection of something, try to identify the ID and number of what inspired him in creating his persona. The flag should follow the format WPCTF{XXXX#NUMBER}.
