# Shadow Garden

An encrypted transmission from The Eminence himself has been intercepted, an ancient video relic known only as intro.mkv.

Once a symbol of power, it has now been tainted. The Cult of Diablos has corrupted the signal, twisting its form and shrouding its true purpose in static and chaos.

Our analysts believe fragments of Shadow’s will still remain within. What you see is merely the surface, the truth lies buried beneath layers of distortion.

Your task is simple in words, but heavy in consequence: restore what has been lost.

Recover the hidden essence of the transmission and prove your worth to the Shadow Garden.
