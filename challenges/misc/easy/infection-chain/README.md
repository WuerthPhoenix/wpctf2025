# MISCELLANEOUS EASY CHALLENGE

`Title`: Infection Chain
`Description`: Explore the workstation and understand what the attackers did
`Challenge Narrative`: An employee returned from lunch to find a ransomnote open in their browser. They insist they didn’t install anything unusual and had only been doing their normal work. The note demands payment within the end of the month and warns that files will be encrypted if the deadline is missed. Management has engaged you to determine what happened. You will be given a disk image of the affected Windows workstation. Everything you need is in that image. Your task is to investigate the compromised machine, identify how the attacker delivered the payload, gained persistence and how they will encrypt all the data.
