# Win12 License Checker

After the deprecation of Windows 10, the IT department has decided to upgrade all
systems to Macrohard Linux 12.

However, they have encountered an issue with license verification. The customer support of Macrohard GmbH provided them a program to validate their license.

Can you help them understand why their key is not working?
